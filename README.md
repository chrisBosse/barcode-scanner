# Barcode Scanner

This is a "Hello World!" mobile app to test [Expo.io](https://expo.io/learn) React Native mobile application.

This app will someday scan a UPC barcode and display the product image onscreen.  At least, that's the plan.  :-)  This is a test project, so do not expect this to actually happen.

I used the [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io/) and installed the app on a old LG Optimus (Verizon prepaid) phone, but I have been looking to take the next steps.

## Steps to Setup

Using Linux operating system (OS) Ubuntu 17.10.

Sign up for Expo account.  <https://expo.io/signup>

Install latest `nvm` scripts.  (Node Version Manager, makes swapping Node and NPM versions easier.)  <https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script>

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
```

Log out and then log back in again for updated profile settings to take effect.

Install Node.  (Note, I am got a warning with this Node version later on, but have been able to continue thus far.)

```text
[exp] Warning: You are using npm version 5.6.0. There may be bugs in this version, use it at your own risk. We recommend version 4.6.1.
```

```bash
nvm install 8.9
nvm use 8.9
```

Then follow the [Expo.io step-by-step guide](https://expo.io/learn) from Step 3.  Get the Command Line Tool
